## venus-market 是什么?

venus-market version 2 is the latest release for a Venus storage system to handle deal-making process. It grants storage providers a seamless deal-taking experience while allowing maximum flexibility if storage providers still choose to take matters into their own hands.   

## venus-market Features

### Chain service deployment

One of the most distinct features that venus-market v2 has is that if a storage provider is using a chain service with venus-market v2, then she/he doesn’t need to deploy a market node locally at all, making the whole deal-taking experience just like sealing a CC sector!

### Multiple data transfer protocol support

The transfer of deal data from the chain service to storage provider will not only support graphsync, OSS but also other popular data transfer protocols like HTTP (coming).

### Light weight storage client

venus-market v2 comes with a light weight client can be used to make storage deals without the need of deploying a fully synced local node. A storage client can go on making storage deals once the client connects to a Venus chain service.

### Compatibility with other implementation

As a storage provider using Venus storage system, you will enjoy complete comparability with other implementations, which means you have the flexibility to take deals from other storage clients or deal distribution system too.  

### Developer friendly

APIs and SDKs will be opened up to allow storage providers with programming background to further customize their deal-taking workflow.
